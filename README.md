# Sentiment Analysis
### Classifying documents based on their polarity: attitude of writer. This works with a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from Internet Movie Database(ImDb) available at [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) to build a predictor that can distinguish between positive and negative reviews.
### Two methods are implemented-
### * [Using Grid Search for Hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/iamdsc/sentiment-analysis/tree/master/main-1.py)
      Accuracy: 89.9 %
### * [Using Out-of-Core Learning](https://github.com/iamdsc/sentiment-analysis/tree/master/main-2.py)
      Accuracy: 87.8 %
